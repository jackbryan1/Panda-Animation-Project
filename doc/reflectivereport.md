Reflective Report
===========
I have never used PyCharm Integrated Development Environment or the Python programming language, however I have used Visual Basic and the Visual Studio integrated development environment. The programming languages use different syntax which feels a bit weird after 4 years of using almost exclusively Visual Basic. Other new tools are the markdown file type, version control, and the dependency management tool, all of which I have never used before.
