Reflective Report
===========
I have never used PyCharm Integrated Development Environment or the Python programming language, however I have used Visual Basic and the Visual Studio integrated development environment. These two programming languages use different syntax which feels a bit weird after 4 years of using almost exclusively Visual Basic, but on the whole it was not too different and was fairly easy to get used to using Python. Other new tools are the markdown file type, version control, and the dependency management tool, all of which I have never used before.

These tools will all be useful for future projects. I think that version control in particular will be very useful, as it will allow me to test changes without the risk of breaking the code, which will make the overall process of creating a program
